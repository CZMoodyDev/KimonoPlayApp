This long-sleeved kimono started to appear in the latter half of the Edo period, when commoners, particulary amongst the merchant class, were gaining financial power and more luxury items were produced for their consumption. It was a way to show the power of one's wealth by dressing daughters in gorgeous furisode kimono. Wearing furisode also indicated that a girl was eligible to marry. The furisode kimono can be worn up until the marriage ceremony, but after marriage or after a certain age, women wear shorter sleeved kimono. In the past, fuirsode was for girls younger than 20 years old, and became the attire for young women to attend seijin-shiki or the comming-of-age ceremony. It was established by rule in 1948 that 20 years of age is acknowledged as a legal adult in Japan."
